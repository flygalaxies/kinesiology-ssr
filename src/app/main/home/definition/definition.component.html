        Kinesiology works with muscles, the body, and its own energy. It helps resolve all kinds of problems in life, unwellness,
        stress and relieves pain. It works well with goal setting and future issues which may arise.

        Kinesiology is a communication tool that enables a person to assess and upgrade their perfomance in all areas of their life,
        It is the science of energy balancing and is grounded in the study of anatomy and physiology.

        Muscle testing is a profound method that allows the Kinesiologist to “talk to your body”. Physical issues, such as pain,
        muscle or other structural impairment as a result of surgery, injury or traumatic experiences are dealt with on a
        neurological level.
