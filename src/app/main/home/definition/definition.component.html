        stress and relieves pain. It works well with goal setting and future issues which may arise.

        Muscle testing is a profound method that allows the Kinesiologist to “talk to your body”. Physical issues, such as pain,
        muscle or other structural impairment as a result of surgery, injury or traumatic experiences are dealt with on a
        neurological level.
